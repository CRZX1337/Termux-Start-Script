# Termux Auto Setup Script

This script, `start.sh`, is designed to automate the initial setup of a new Termux environment. It performs several common tasks to get your Termux ready for use quickly.

**Features:**

*   **Removes the default Termux Message Of The Day (MOTD):** Cleans up the initial terminal output for a cleaner look.
*   **Updates and Upgrades Packages:** Ensures your Termux system is running the latest versions of packages by performing `apt update` and `apt upgrade`.
*   **Installs Essential Packages:** Installs a set of commonly used tools and utilities, including:
    *   `git`: For version control and cloning repositories.
    *   `curl`: For transferring data with URLs.
    *   `wget`: For downloading files from the web.
    *   `zip` and `unzip`: For working with compressed files.
    *   `python` and `python-pip`: For Python development and package management.
    *   `neofetch`: A command-line system information tool.
*   **Installs and Runs T-Header:** Clones the [T-Header](https://github.com/CRZX1337/T-Header) repository (presumably another script or tool you've created) and executes `t-header.sh`.
*   **Configures Neofetch on Startup:** Automatically runs `neofetch` every time you start a new Termux session, displaying system information.

**Installation and Usage:**

1.  **Open Termux:** Launch your Termux application on your Android device.

2.  **Update and Upgrade Packages (Initial Termux Setup):** Run the following command to ensure your base Termux installation is up to date:
    ```bash
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    ```

3.  **Install Git:**  Git is required to clone this repository. Install it using:
    ```bash
    apt install git -y
    ```

4.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone this `Termux-Start-Script` repository to your Termux home directory using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CRZX1337/Termux-Start-Script.git
    ```

5.  **Navigate to the Repository Directory:** Change your current directory to the newly cloned repository:
    ```bash
    cd Termux-Start-Script/
    ```

6.  **Make the `start.sh` Script Executable:**  Grant execute permissions to the `start.sh` script:
    ```bash
    chmod +x start.sh
    ```

7.  **Run the Setup Script:** Execute the `start.sh` script to begin the automated setup process:
    ```bash
    ./start.sh
    ```

    The script will run through the steps outlined in the "Features" section, providing output in the terminal as it progresses.

8.  **Restart Termux (Optional but Recommended):** After the script completes, it's a good idea to close and restart Termux to ensure all changes, especially the `neofetch` startup, are fully applied.

**Customization:**

You can customize the `start.sh` script to fit your specific needs:

*   **Add or Remove Packages:**  Edit the `start.sh` file and modify the `apt install` commands to include or exclude packages you want or don't want installed.
*   **Modify T-Header Integration:**  Adjust the T-Header cloning and execution commands if you need to change how T-Header is handled.
*   **Add More Setup Steps:**  Extend the script to include other configurations or installations you typically perform after setting up Termux.

**Important Notes and Warnings:**

*   **Internet Connection Required:** This script requires an active internet connection to download packages and clone repositories.
*   **Script Execution from the Internet:**  Be cautious when running scripts downloaded from the internet, especially those with `sudo` or root privileges (though this script does not use `sudo`).  Always review the script's contents to understand what it does before executing it.  This script is provided as is, and you are responsible for understanding and running it.
*   **`rm -rf` Command:** The script uses `rm -rf` to remove the MOTD files. While safe in this specific context, be extremely careful when using `rm -rf` in general, as it can permanently delete files and directories without prompting.
*   **T-Header Dependency:** This script depends on the `T-Header` repository being available at the specified URL. If the repository is removed or moved, that part of the script will fail.

**Disclaimer:**

Use this script at your own risk. The author is not responsible for any issues or damage caused by running this script.  It is recommended to understand the script's functionality before execution.
